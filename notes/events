It's time to start drawing the windows.

Hit '|'
  -> split window
    -> adjust window sizes down the tree
      -> redraw the windows

  Do the windows draw themselves?

  We need to draw the windows atomically ... I think.

  Unless each window just draws _itself_ atomically.

  Only individual draw calls need to be atomic:
  - move cursor
  - draw something

  We need atomic operations only so that the cursor doesn't
  get moved when we're in the middle of a draw call:

  Get draw call: move to 10,21
  move cursor to 10,21
  Get draw call: move to 0,3
  move cursor to 0,3
  Get draw call: print "hi"
  print "hi"
  Get draw call: print "bye"

  Both draw calls are at 0,3 because the cursor was "stolen".
